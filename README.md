### - Local Instilation - 
 If you have no programming skills I highly reccomend adding the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=783796609405812777&permissions=335015921&scope=bot) rather than hosting this bot locally. Otherwise if you want to run the server locally rather than adding the bot through the link above you can follow the steps here. 

**- Install Required Programs -**

Before you download Flame, there are some dependancies you need to install first to ensure everything works as it should. Here are 2 programs that you need to install: 

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

**- Download Project Files -**

After you have the required programs installed,  you can now download Flame. There are 2 different ways to do this, either download the zip folder, or clone it with git which i reccomend. To do this run `git clone https://github.com/goldentg/Flame.git` in a command console. 

**- Add Required Information -**
Once you have downloaded the bot files, you must now create a file named `config.json` and add the following into that file: 
```
{
    "token": "INSERT-TOKEN-HERE",
    "prefix": "-"
}
```
**- Running The Bot -**
Once the previous steps have been completed you can now run the bot. 
To do so you can either run the `run.bat` file, or run `node .` in a CMD.
