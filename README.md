### - Notes -
This bot is still in early development and frequent updates will be rolling out often. Check back in often to see what is new. Suggerstions for future implementations are appreciated and can be left in the discussions tab.

### - DISSCUSION - 
I have enabled discussions on this repo. You can communicate with me or other users there. If you wish to leave a suggestion for a future update you can also do so in the "suggestions" discussion. You can visit the discussion tab by clicking it at the top of the site, or by [clicking here](https://github.com/goldentg/Flame/discussions).


### - Local Instilation - 
 If you have no programming skills I highly reccomend adding the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=783796609405812777&permissions=335015921&scope=bot) rather than hosting this bot locally. Otherwise if you want to run the server locally rather than adding the bot through the link above you can follow the steps here. 

**- Install Required Programs -**

Before you download Flame, there are some dependancies you need to install first to ensure everything works as it should. Here are 2 programs that you need to install: 

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

**- Download Project Files -**

After you have the required programs installed,  you can now download Flame. There are 2 different ways to do this, either download the zip folder, or clone it with git which i reccomend. To do this run `git clone https://github.com/goldentg/Flame.git` in a command console. 

**- Add Required Information -**
Once you have downloaded the bot files, you must now create a file named `config.json` and add the following into that file: 
```
{
    "token": "INSERT-TOKEN-HERE",
    "prefix": "-"
}
```
**- Running The Bot -**
Once the previous steps have been completed you can now run the bot. 
To do so you can either run the `run.bat` file, or run `node .` in a CMD.
